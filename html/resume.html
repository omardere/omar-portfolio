            I use HTML & CSS every day, and I try to keep up with the latest features while maintaining graceful degradation.

            I use JavaScript fairly often  and i use react js .
    
    My main server-side language is PHP and spring boot java, quite often paired with MySQL. I usually use WordPress for client sites, depending on requirements.
     I specialize in custom themes, and have also built custom plugins for unique functionality.
    
    I’ve developed several iOS and Android apps, both using flutter framework based on dart language.
    
    I use Git for all of my programming work. Check out my GitHub page for random projects and contributions to other open source projects.
    
    I primarily use GitHub’s Atom text editor for coding.
